            The saying, "the house always wins" is a prevalent belief encountered in the world of gambling and luck.
            As one of my favorite quotes about luck says:
            <br><br>
            <span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
                <i>"I believe that whether you play or not, your odds of winning the lottery remain the same."<br>
                    - Fran Lebowitz</i>
            </span>
            <br>
            But what if we were to challenge the notion that the house always comes out on top? Similar to card
            counting, there exist a multitude of strategies to outsmart the house when it comes to gambling or
            betting on outcomes.
            <br><br>
            Let’s delve into one such method called arbitrage betting.
            <br><br>
            According to the Oxford Dictionary, "<b>arbitrage</b>" refers to the practice of buying something (for example,
            shares or foreign money) in one place, and selling it in another place where the price is higher.
            <br><br>
            The idea behind arbitrage betting is to take advantage of the discrepancy between prices, or in betting
            terms, the odds offered by different bookmakers. If enough of a discrepancy exists, then we are able to
            place bets covering all possible outcomes of an event, with each of those bets having a winning outcome
            that would cover the cost to place each bet and some. Before diving into an example, let’s discuss some
            different types of betting odds, along with how we can convert these odds into probabilities.
            <br><br>
            The two types of odds we will discuss are <b>decimal odds</b> (also known as European odds) and
            <b>money line odds</b>. (also known as American odds).
            <br><br>
            Decimal odds represents the amount one wins for every $1 wagered. This amount includes the initial stake
            you bet with, so it represents your total payout, not your profit.
            <br><br>
            Money line odds are accompanied by either a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (-). The number accompanying a
            plus sign indicates the amount of money you would win for each $100 wagered. The number accompanying a
            minus sign indicates the amount of money you would need to wager to win $100. Unlike decimal odds, these
            numbers represent profit, meaning that you are returned your initial stake <i>plus</i> your winnings if your
            bet is correct.
            <br><br>
            Below is a calculator to convert between the two types of odds, along with the formulas.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; font-size: 16px">
            <div style="width: 55%">

                    <label for="ml_box">Money Line Odds:</label>
                    <input type="number" id="ml_box" oninput="mltodec('ml_box','dec_box')">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Now that we know how the different types of odds work, we can see how to convert them to their
            implied probabilities. The formula for implied probability is your total stake for the bet divided
            by the total payout (initial stake plus profit).
            <br><br>
            For decimal odds, the implied probability is simply the inverse of the odds.
            <br><br>
            For money line odds, it depends on whether the odds are positive or negative. Implied probability
            for positive money line odds are calculated by dividing 100, your wager amount, by the possible return,
            which would be 100 plus the money line odds. Implied probability for negative money line odds are
            calculated by dividing the money line odds, by the money line odds minus 100.

        <p>
            Now that we have covered the basics, let's look at an example. Imagine we want to bet on the Toronto
            Blue Jays versus the New York Yankees. A bookmaker gives us decimal odds of 2.3 for the Blue Jays and
            1.7 for the Yankees. Converting these into implied probabilities, we have 43.48% for the Blue Jays,
            and 58.82% for the Yankees.
            <br><br>
            You might have noticed that those do not add to 100% (43.48% + 58.82% = 102.30%). That is because these
            are not “fair” odds. The margin over 100%, in this case 2.30%, represents the bookmaker's potential
            profit margins. So if we were to place two bets, one on each team to win, proportional to their implied
            probabilities to win, we would have placed $102.30 in bets, with a guaranteed winning of $100. Obviously
            this is a bad bet.
            <br><br>
            When we revisit the definition of arbitrage, we are reminded that we need two different places to
            buy and sell. So, we find a second bookmaker.
            <br><br>
            This bookmaker believes that the Blue Jays and Yankees are more evenly matched, and so is offering
            decimal odds of 2.15 for the Blue Jays and 1.8 for the Yankees. Calculating the implied probabilities
            for this bookmaker yields 46.51% for the Blue Jays and 55.56% for the Yankees. Again, we see that these
            are not fair odds as the sum is greater than 100% (46.51% + 55.56% = 102.07%).
            <br><br>
            However, something interesting happens when we consider making one bet with one bookmaker, and one bet
            with the other. If we were to place one bet with the first bookmaker for the Blue Jays to win at 2.3
            (43.48%) and another bet with the second bookmaker for the Yankees to win at 1.8 (55.56%), we can see
            the implied probabilities sum to less than 100% (43.48% + 55.56% = 99.04%). This means the odds are no
            longer in favor of the bookmakers — instead, they are in our favor.
            <br><br>
            If we place bets that are proportional to the implied probabilities on each team to win — in our case,
            betting $43.48 on the Blue Jays to win at 2.3, and $55.56 on the Yankees to win at 1.8 — we are
            <i>guaranteed</i> profit. In total we spent $43.48 + $55.56 = $99.04 on our bets. If the Blue Jays win,
            we have a payout of 2.3 x $43.48 = $100. If the Yankees win, we have a payout of 1.8 x $55.56 = $100.
            Therefore, we have profited $0.96 for our $100 investment, or approximately a 1% return. While this does
            seem like a small return, the important piece to remember is that this is a guaranteed return. By using
            arbitrage, all chance has been removed from the equation. Regardless of the outcome of the game, the 1%
            profit will exist.

            Although not living up the to “get rich quick scheme” promised in the article description, we see that
            despite the common belief that the "the house always wins," using math we have found not only a way to
            turn the odds in our favor, but actually creates a guaranteed return, taking all the risk out of betting.
