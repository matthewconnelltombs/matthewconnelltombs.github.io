        </div>

        <p>
            Geysers are fascinating natural wonders – the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park being 
            one of the most famous in the world. To me, one of the most beautiful things about Old Faithful is – 
            you guessed it – the numbers!
            <br><br>
            Beyond its captivating eruptions lies a wealth of data that can be explored to uncover hidden patterns 
            and relationships. In this analysis, we delve into the Old Faithful eruption dataset, using four 
            distinct clustering techniques: K-Means, Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS), 
            Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). 
            <br><br>
            Our goal is to unravel the underlying structures behind the eruptions, shedding light on the dynamics 
            of this geological phenomenon. Let’s start off by reviewing these clustering techniques:

                    <li>It models the underlying probabilistic distribution and forms clusters from a probabilistic perspective.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        I have chosen to do this analysis in R using a R markdown file.

            <p>The Results</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <p>
            We can first visualize our data and make some predictions about what we might expect. It appears there are two 
            main clusters, one centering around (2, 55) and the other around (4.3, 80). We can also see that there are a 
            few points in between the two clusters – it is difficult to determine which cluster these belong to.
        </p>



        <p class="mini_title">
            K-Means
        </p>

        <p>
            When we turn to K-Means, we're entering the realm of simplicity and clarity. K-Means is a straightforward 
            algorithm that partitions data into distinct groups based on their proximity to each other.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="kmean/k_means_elbow.jpg" alt=""/>
            <img src="kmean/k_means_norm.jpg" alt=""/>
        </div>

        <p>
            The algorithm does this by identifying central points in the data, called <b>centroids</b>, around which clusters form. 
            The number of these clusters is determined by the user (k value). Although we believe that in this dataset, there 
            should be two clusters, K-Means provides ways to check that. One of the ways we can check is the <b>Elbow Method</b>. We 
            plot the total within sum of squares for a range of numbers of clusters, and look for an “elbow” in the line. 
            Here we can clearly see this occurs at k=2, indicating there are two clusters.
            <br><br>
            As K-Means runs on the data, it assigns each eruption to the cluster whose centroid is closest. This process 
            repeats until the algorithm converges, and we have well-defined clusters. We can see here K-Means is able to 
            classify all but one point correctly (3.4, 65).
            <br><br>
            This emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of K-Means in capturing intricate structures 
            within the data. Despite this, K-Means remains a valuable tool for initial insights, offering a clear segmentation 
            of eruptions and laying the foundation for further refinement in analysis.

            <br>
        </p>



        <p class="mini_title">
            OPTICS
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As we navigate through the OPTICS algorithm, we find it steering away from the rigid cluster assignments of 
            algorithms like K-Means. Instead, OPTICS explores the dataset, taking into account the varying density of 
            data points. It begins by sorting points based on their <b>reachability distances</b>, a measure of how far each 
            point is from its nearest neighbor.
            <br><br>
            The resulting reachability plot is a visual representation of the dataset's landscape, with peaks and valleys 
            reflecting areas of high and low data density. These peaks become potential cluster centers, and the 
            valleys define natural separations between clusters.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="optics/reach_norm.jpg" alt=""/>
            <img src="optics/optics_norm.jpg" alt=""/>
        </div>

        <p>
            Unlike K-Means, where you define the number of clusters, in OPTICS you use an epsilon value, a cutoff value that 
            establishes the maximum distance for a point to be considered part of a cluster. This parameter allows for a dynamic 
            and adaptive clustering process, where the granularity of clusters can be adjusted based on the characteristics of the data.
            <br><br>
            One of OPTICS' strengths lies in its ability to handle clusters of varying shapes and sizes, making it particularly 
            well-suited for this particular dataset. As we choose an epsilon, we not only identify clusters but also pinpoint 
            outliers – data points beyond the reach of any cluster. This dual capability provides a nuanced understanding of 
            the Old Faithful dataset, allowing us to capture both the regularity of clustered eruptions and the anomalies lying in isolation.
            <br><br>
            OPTICS appears to have done a better job clustering the points, with the algorithm deeming one point between the two 
            clusters as noise. OPTICS faces challenges in accurately clustering data when the data clusters have varying densities.

        <p>
            Think of Hierarchical Clustering as the storyteller of our data. Instead of abruptly assigning data points to clusters, 
            it weaves a tale of relationships, creating a dendrogram – a family tree of eruptions, if you will.
            <br><br>
            As we explore the Old Faithful eruption dataset through the lens of Hierarchical Clustering, the dendrogram unfolds, 
            revealing connections and hierarchies. This visual narrative provides a nuanced understanding of the relationships 
            between eruptions.
            <br><br>
            What makes the use of Hierarchical Clustering particularly insightful for our data is its ability to showcase nested 
            clusters. Like discovering hidden chapters within a larger story, we can zoom in or out to explore overarching trends 
            or pinpoint specific details. This hierarchical view captures not only the broader patterns of eruption similarities 
            but also the subtle nuances that might be overlooked in a more rigid clustering approach.
            <br><br>
            While Hierarchical Clustering has many strengths, it also comes with a number of weaknesses. These include; being 
            computationally expensive, having sensitivity to noise and outliers, lack of interpretability for large dendrograms.
        </p>



        <p class="mini_title">
            Gaussian Mixture Models
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Gaussian Mixture Models, or GMM, is a statistical method that takes a probabilistic stance in understanding data. 
            Unlike some clustering techniques, GMM don't force data –  in our case, eruptions – into predefined clusters. 
            Instead, it assumes that the dataset is a mixture of several probability distributions.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="gmm/GMM_poor_1.jpg" alt=""/>
            <img src="gmm/GMM_poor_2.jpg" alt=""/>
            <img src="gmm/GMM_proper_1.jpg" alt=""/>
            <img src="gmm/GMM_proper_2.jpg" alt=""/>
        </div>

        <p>
            In simple terms, GMM imagines that each eruption is generated by a unique blend of these distributions. It then 
            iteratively refines its estimates of these distributions until it finds the best fit for the data.
            <br><br>
            The initial choice of probability distributions in GMM is crucial, as it not only influences the efficiency of the 
            algorithm but also affects its susceptibility to getting stuck at suboptimal solutions during the iterative refinement 
            process. We can see here that if a poor starting distribution is chosen, the algorithm can misclassify the clusters.
            <br><br>        
            To get around selecting starting distributions, we can loop over random starting distributions and save whichever 
            results in the best clustering (using log likelihood). This can help ensure we find the most optimal clustering.
            <br><br>
            GMM offers a unique perspective compared to other clustering techniques. Instead of clustering the data points 
            into groups, GMM focuses on the probabilistic structures behind the data, allowing us to get a better understanding 
            of not just the recorded eruptions, but how the eruptions happen.
            <br><br>
            The two biggest drawbacks about GMM is that we must make the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for clusters, 
            and that GMM can often get caught in local optima.
            <br><br><br>

            Conclusion
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope this has provided a helpful visualization of some important clustering techniques. When people think of Old Faithful, 
            their first thought probably isn’t, “hm, I wonder how I can break down the eruption data for this geyser”. But I think 
            it’s awesome, taking things from all parts of life – nature, sports, entertainment, politics, etc. – and watching the 
            numbers erupt.
