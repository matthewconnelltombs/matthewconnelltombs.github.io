            Acquire is a strategy board game where players assume the role of real estate tycoons. Designed for
            2 to 6 players, the game revolves around building and expanding hotel chains, alongside making
            strategic investments. Players strategically place tiles to create, expand, and connect hotel chains.
            This allows them to earn stocks and shareholder bonuses. The game requires careful planning and
            calculated decision-making as players compete to gain majority ownership of hotel chains,
            triggering lucrative buyouts.
            <br><br>
            After successfully <a href="../yahtzee/yahtzee.html">coding Yahtzee in Python</a>, I decided it
            was time to up the difficulty and code another favorite, yet slightly more complicated board game,
            Acquire. If you’re familiar with Acquire, you’ll know that it is a pretty old game, and quite
            difficult to find in stores -- so that was another incentive for me to code it!
            <br><br>
            Similarly to Yahtzee, this game is implemented in Python using the pygame and numpy libraries.

            The player names are stored in a .txt file with the .py file. Each player's turn starts with
            clearing any player information, and a prompt for whose turn it is. They then can see their
            hand of tiles, stocks they own, and remaining money. Players continue placing tiles until a
            hotel chain is formed. After selecting the chain, the true fun of the game starts as players
            can now start buying stocks in the chain, start other rival hotel chains, and eventually force
            acquisitions. During a merger, if there ever is a tie in size of hotels, the active player
            decides which hotel is to be treated as the larger one. Once the end game conditions are met,
            on their turn each player is asked if they want to end the game. Once it’s game over, the final
            scores are calculated and displayed so the winner can start celebrating!
