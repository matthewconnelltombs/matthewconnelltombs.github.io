            Cascadia is a tile-laying board game where players create diverse ecosystems by strategically placing tiles
            that represent different landscapes, such as forests, rivers, and mountains. Each tile attracts specific
            wildlife species, represented by animal tokens. Players score points by creating large groupings of one
            kind of ecosystem along with creating specifically shaped packs of animal tokens. At the end of the game,
            the highest scoring habitat wins! If you want to read more about Cascadia, click
            <a href="https://www.alderac.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cascadia-Rules.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            I am a huge fan of Cascadia. I think it has something to do with the fact that each turn requires you to
            only make one decision; a decision that seems simple, and yet can be extremely impactful to your chances
            of winning or losing the game. However, at the end of the game, all players have to stare at their boards
            and try to count their points. Sometimes it's easy. Sometimes it’s not. And sometimes (often) I’m a
            little lazy.
            <br><br>
            So, I decided to try and create an app that takes as input pictures of the players boards, and outputs
            the final score.
            <br><br>
            I will note ahead of time that getting image recognition for certain parts of the game (i.e. habitats) is
            expected to be extremely difficult. I will be prioritizing scoring the animal tokens and nature tokens
            first, and then attempting the habitats.

            Note: I have made progress towards completing this project, however there will be an update in the future
            when the project is finished!
            <br><br>
            To score the player boards, I needed the app to have the ability to recognize animals, nature tokens,
            and habitat tiles. For image recognition and segmentation, I decided to use ultralytics YOLOv8. As there
            was not a ready made dataset, I scraped
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295947/cascadia" target="_blank">BoardGameGeek’s Cascadia</a>
            page for images of player boards to train on. I used the package LabelImg to classify the different animals
            and nature tokens. After that, it just came down to training the models.
            <br><br>
            I chose to train two separate models, one for the nature tokens, and one for the animals.
            They both took surprisingly little time!
            <br><br>
            For the nature tokens, this is essentially all that needed to be done, as a player scores one point per
            token. Counting the number of detected objects gives us the points scored.
            <br><br>
            However, for animal scoring, there is much more ahead. The animals are scored on their relative positions
            to each other, meaning that I needed to be able to detect which animals are beside other animals, which
            animals are between other animals, and so on. For this I decided to recreate the hexagonal grid of the
            board, ignoring the habitats and transforming the animals into the tiles. This would then hopefully
            simplify a lot of the calculations for determining adjacency and such things.
            <br><br>
            I did this by starting with the midpoint of each detected animal and using that as the center of my
            hexagons. For the hexagonal grid, I had a number of options to choose from for a coordinate system. I had
            originally planned on using an <b>offset coordinate system</b>, where each tile has two coordinates and
            depending on even/odd, you would know if it was an offset row/column. I ended up changing my mind — while
            probably easier to initially code, I anticipated problems could arise with more complicated calculations.
            <br><br>
            So instead, I decided on the <b>cube coordinate system</b>, where there are 3 axes, so each tile had 3
            coordinates, with the nifty property that they sum to 0. This proved to make further calculations quite
            straightforward. Knowing that all animals must be touching another animal, I decided to take the approach
            of starting to recreate the grid with one animal, then add all adjacent animals to the original one, and
            then one by one add all adjacent animals to each of those, and so on. After that, I just had to grab the
            animal type when drawing the tile and color it.
            <br><br>
            Below is a series of pictures showing every step: the original board, image detection of animal tokens,
            image detection of nature tokens, game board mid points, hexagonal game board, hexagonal game board with
            animal colors.

        <p>
            At this point, the board is fully recreated, and so now it is time to score it.
            <br><br>
            There are 3 avenues for scoring points in Cascadia: animals, nature tokens, and habitats.
            <br><br>
            As far as animal scoring goes, players spend the game strategically placing animals to achieve wildlife
            goals. The wildlife goals for a given game are determined by wildlife scoring cards that are selected at
            the start of the game. There are 5 animals, and each has 4 variations of scoring cards — so 20 different
            functions. Once those were complete, it was as simple as having the user provide a path to the image and
            input the scoring cards in play (A, B, C, or D for each animal type).
            <br><br>
            As I mentioned earlier, nature tokens are simple — one point per token.  Now, we can score two of the
            three different point scoring methods. At this point the function takes < 1 second to score a player board.
        </p>

        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="score.JPG" alt="" style="height: 200px">
        </div>

        <p>
            The next step will be implementing image segmentation for the habitats, and then scoring them. I have
            already started on this, and while having had some success, it is proving difficult to build a model that
            can accurately detect all habitats with very high accuracy. There are 2 main things that make scoring the
            habitats difficult:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Players place animals <i>on</i> the habitat tiles, covering a large portion of them.</li>
                <li>The different habitats are represented by non-homogenous designs, involving varying colors
                    and patterns. This is much more difficult to detect than consistent, uniform patterns.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            I am currently working to solve this issue, and will update this once I have something!
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 15px">
            (Or I’ll have to shamefully go back to scoring the game manually.)
